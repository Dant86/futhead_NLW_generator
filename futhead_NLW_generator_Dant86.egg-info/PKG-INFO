Description: # Futhead NLW Generator
        
        # Brief Description
        - Generates an NLW squad using Futhead's ratings.
            - NLW means "no links wasted", meaning that each player has as many dead links as strong links in a squad.
        - Given no constraints, it should construct the highest possible rated squad.
        - The algorithm should be along the lines of recursive backtracking -- inefficient but easy. I suspect the slowest part of this application will be checking if the squad satisfies the NLW constraints.
        
        # TODO
        - Pull ratings from Futhead
