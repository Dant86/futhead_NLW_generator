# Futhead NLW Generator

# Brief Description
- Generates an NLW squad using Futhead's ratings.
    - NLW means "no links wasted", meaning that each player has as many dead links as strong links in a squad.
- Given no constraints, it should construct the highest possible rated squad.
- The algorithm should be along the lines of recursive backtracking -- inefficient but easy. I suspect the slowest part of this application will be checking if the squad satisfies the NLW constraints.

# TODO
- Represent formations as graphs
